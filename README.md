# A320 or 737?

I like airplanes, and I have quite a few friends who do too. A lot of our conversations revolve around aircraft types, so my first instinct when I see one in the sky is to try to identify it. Is it a Boeing, an Airbus, or something else? Which model is it...and which variant of said model? There are key features like the shape and size of the wings, fuselage, and engines which allow us humans (or maybe only the aviation nerds) to distinguish aircraft models.

As someone who knew close to nothing about computer vision, I wanted to see whether a model could be trained to identify aircraft like I do with my friends. This project is my first baby step: **can a neural network be trained to differentiate between an Airbus A320 and a Boeing 737?** The A320 and 737 were chosen because they are physically similar, making the problem of classification more interesting than choosing two aircraft that are obviously different (for example, an Airbus A320 and a Boeing 747 are easily distinguished by their size and the number of engines).

My goal here is to train a model which can classify images from any source beyond the dataset used here; be it Google Images, an aviation blog, or a photo taken by a user. If you have any comments, advice, or questions, I'd love to hear from you through LinkedIn - here's [my profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kento-seki/)!
